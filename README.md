# GameKeeper

GameKeeper is a full stack application in which users can create a library of games and track each play session of those games.

## Background
I have always considered myself to be a gamer--not just in the contemporary sense but in regards to every medium available. I am originally from Las Vegas and grew up (and was briefly employed) in the casino industry. As such, card games and other games of chance have made their way into my family's game time. Being avid gamers, we're all quite competitive. Until now, we had no way of keeping track of all the different games we play. Every other app I have used limits the information tracking specifically to a single game medium. Now I'm able to jump across game media and keep track of every play session inside of one app!

## Use Case
This app is perfect for people that play a wide variety of games and want to begin collecting data about each play session that they partake in.
