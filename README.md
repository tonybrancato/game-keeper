Welcome to GameKeeper, where you can keep track of all your games, regardless of their medium.

Track each play of your favorite board game, or keep track of your ongoing Dungeons and Dragons game.

Click 'ADD GAME' to get started and add your first game!

After you've added the game to the library and played it, click 'ADD PLAY' in order to track a play session.

Once your game collection grows a bit, you may want to filter the results. Simply click the corresponding icon at the top of the page to hide games of that type. 
Click again, and they'll come back!

Now get out there and play some games!
